# Welcome to Omm
<p>Liquid staking for ICX, the ICON blockchain's native currency.</p>


ICX staking rewards average ~6.5% per year. To earn them traditionally, you need to lock up ICX and vote for ICON blockchain validators. You have to claim rewards manually, and you won't have access to your ICX until you unstake it â€“ a process that takes around 7 days.

Omm provides an easier way.

It converts ICX to Staked ICX (sICX), an asset that earns staking rewards while remaining available to use. Omm claims and stakes rewards daily, so the ICX value of sICX increases over time. When you need ICX, you can pay a 1% fee to swap sICX for ICX instantly. You don't even need to care about ICON validators unless you want to give a specific team your support.

<br />
Use Omm to:
- Convert ICX to sICX
- Unstake sICX instantly or initiate the unstaking process
- Delegate votes to ICON validators
- Influence how much sICX each validator earns from the protocol fee

<br />
Use sICX to:
- Earn passive staking rewards
- Borrow bnUSD on [Balanced](https://balanced.network/)
- Supply liquidity on [Balanced](https://balanced.network/)
