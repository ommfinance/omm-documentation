# Testnet app
Learn how to use Omm on the Lisbon testnet.

## Sign in to the testnet app
You can access the test version of Omm from [test.omm.finance](https://test.omm.finance/).

Make sure your wallet is set to the Lisbon testnet before you sign in.

## Add testnet assets to your wallet

To test Omm, you'll need some testnet ICX.

After you sign in:

1. Click the wallet menu in the top right and choose 'Copy ICON address'.
2. Go to [faucet.iconosphere.io](https://faucet.iconosphere.io/) and choose the Lisbon testnet.
3. Paste your address, then click 'Send me test ICX'.

Youâ€™ll receive 2,001 testnet ICX in a few moments.

You can then use ICX to get testnet OMM from [test.balanced.network/trade](https://test.balanced.network/trade/ICX_OMM). If there's no OMM available, visit the [Omm Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/zZcQUGbpVk) to request some.
