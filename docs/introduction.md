# Welcome to Balanced
<p></p>

Balanced is home to the Balanced Dollar stablecoin, bnUSD, and includes an exchange to service all blockchains connected to the [ICON Network](https://whyicx.com).

As a decentralised protocol, Balanced is governed by its community through the Balance Token (BALN). You can buy BALN from the [Balanced exchange](https://app.balanced.network/trade/bnUSD_BALN), and earn it when you borrow bnUSD or supply liquidity. When locked, BALN holds voting power and boosts your earning potential.

You can use Balanced on ICON and Archway. Additional blockchains coming soon.
