# Manage a validator wallet
Learn how to claim rewards and monitor your ICX delegation.

If you're an ICON validator, sICX and bOMM holders can delegate voting power to you. Your bOMM delegation also entitles you to a share of the [protocol fee](/protocol-details#protocol-fee).

All validators can earn a share of the fee, but **your commission rate must be 10% or less to receive ICX delegation**.

Validators must be in the top 100 to appear in the list, which updates weekly.

To claim your rewards:

1. Go to the [Vote page](https://app.omm.finance/#/vote) and sign in with the wallet that receives your validator rewards.
2. Click 'Claim rewards' in the Validator Rewards section, then complete the transaction.
