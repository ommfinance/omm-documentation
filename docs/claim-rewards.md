# Claim rewards
Learn how to earn and claim Balance Tokens and network fees.

Balanced distributes rewards in the form of Balance Tokens and network fees. They accrue in real time, so you can claim yours from [Home](https://app.balanced.network) > Rewards whenever you have a balance available.

## Balance Tokens
To earn Balance Tokens, [borrow bnUSD](/borrow-bnusd) or [supply liquidity](/supply-liquidity) to an incentivised pool.

To boost the amount of BALN you earn for each activity, [lock up Balance Tokens](/lock-BALN).

## Network fees
To earn a share of the network fees, [lock up Balance Tokens](/lock-BALN). bBALN holders receive 30% of the network fee earnings: the more bBALN you hold, the larger your share.

## Liquidity bribes
If you hold bBALN, you can [incentivise liquidity pools](/incentivise-liquidity) and earn a kickback for it. You can claim bribes from the [Vote page](https://app.balanced.network/vote/) once per week.
