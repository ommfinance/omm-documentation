# Vote for ICON validators
<p>Learn how to use sICX and bOMM to participate in ICON governance.</p>

When staked, ICX has the power to participate in ICON's voting system. To secure the network, traditionally-staked ICX requires you to vote for ICON validators ('nodes' that verify transactions for the blockchain). ICON validators earn ICX based on the number of votes they receive, and you need to vote to earn staking rewards.

sICX is different. **Voting is optional**, but many like to support validators who build out the ecosystem.

You can delegate votes to ICON validators using sICX and/or bOMM:

- **sICX:** Manage the delegation preference for sICX held in your wallet.
- **bOMM:** Influence the default delegation for unmanaged sICX, and the percentage of ICX that validators earn from the protocol fee.


All validators can earn a share of the protocol fee, but they must have a commission rate of 10% or less to qualify for ICX delegation.


## Delegate your votes
To adjust your delegation, open the [Vote page](https://app.omm.finance/#/vote/) and go to the Validators section, then:

1. Set the list to view sICX or bOMM votes, then click Edit above 'Your delegation'.
2. Enter the percentage you'd like to delegate to each validator (must equal 100%).
3. Click Confirm and complete the transaction.

sICX and bOMM votes are separate, so bOMM holders will have the option to use the same delegation for both lists before they complete the transaction.
